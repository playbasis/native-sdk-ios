Playbasis iOS SDK is a brand new iOS SDK from Playbasis for helping developers integrate their mobile apps with Playbasis gamification API.

The iOS SDK is designed to work effectively with mobile devices. For example, it provides:

High-level function API calls so that developers will find it is relatively easy to work with Playbasis API
However, the SDK didn't limit the access to low-level API calls so that, if needed, developers still can have a finer control
Automatically parse JSON responses into Objective-C objects
Works offline when there is no internet connection as the requests will be stored on the device (in an encrypted way)
Expose phone native features like phone events so it will very easy for developers to track their users' actions and learn more about their behavior
Next, more documentation and resources can be found below:

Developers can sign up here to get API key/secret
